# Stock-Market-COVID19

## Introduction
This was a project completed for my data visualization class. I wanted to investigate the effect the COVID-19 had on the stock market, and understand if it was the pandemic or a market bubble having the detrimental effect on the markter. This has become a branch of the deep learning algorithm, which will be used in the web application project that my team is building.
